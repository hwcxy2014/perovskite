### How to set up startup folder

In Anaconda prompt:
jupyter notebook --generate-config

This generates ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py file with some helpfully commented possible options. To set the default directory add:
## The directory to use for notebooks and kernels.
c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = u'C:\\Users\\mup3\\Desktop'


### How to set up boto to access S3 in Windows:
Create a file called "mycred.txt" and put it into C:\temp This file contains two lines:

AWSAccessKeyId=<your access id>
AWSSecretKey=<your secret key>
